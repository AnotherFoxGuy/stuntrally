# Description

Stunt Rally features 182 tracks in 35 sceneries and 24 vehicles.  
Game modes include:
* Single Race (with Ghost drive, track guide, or Replays),
* Challenges, Championships, Tutorials,
* Multiplayer (no official server) and Split Screen.  

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.  
Both run on GNU/Linux and Windows.  

The game has a **rally** style of driving, mostly on gravel (like Richard Burns Rally),  
with possible **stunt** elements (jumps, loops, pipes) and generates roads from 3D spline.  
It also features few Sci-Fi vehicles and planets.

Full features list on [our Wiki](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=features). Page about Multiplayer [here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=multiplayer).

# Hardware requirements

The recommended minimum hardware is:  
* CPU: with 2 cores, above 2.4GHz,  
* GPU: dedicated, low budget (e.g. GeForce GTX 560 Ti, Radeon RX 570),  
with Shader Model 3.0 supported and 1GB GPU RAM.  

Integrated GPUs and old laptops don't handle the game well or at all.
