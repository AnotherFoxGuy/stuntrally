## Description

Stunt Rally features 198 tracks in 36 sceneries and 25 vehicles.  
Game modes include:
* Single Race (with your Ghost drive, track car guide), Replays,
* Challenges, Championships, Tutorials,
* Multiplayer (info [here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=multiplayer), no official server) and Split Screen.  

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.  
Both run on GNU/Linux and Windows.  

The game has a **rally** style of driving, mostly on gravel (like Richard Burns Rally),  
with possible **stunt** elements (jumps, loops, pipes) and generated roads from 3D spline.  
It also features few Sci-Fi vehicles and planets.

### Hardware requirements

The recommended minimum hardware is:  
* CPU: with 2 cores, above 2.4GHz,  
* GPU: dedicated, low budget (e.g. GeForce GTX 560 Ti, Radeon RX 570),  
with Shader Model 3.0 supported and 1GB GPU RAM.  

Integrated GPUs and old laptops don't handle the game well or at all.

## Game

In game - Esc or Tab key shows/hides GUI.

Quick setup help is on the Welcome screen, shown at game start, or by Ctrl-F1.  
At first, open Options to adjust Screen resolution, pick graphics preset according to your GPU and *do* restart.  
Open Options tab Input, to see or reassign keys, or configure a game controller, info [here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=running#input).  
Game related Hints are available in menu: How to drive, with few driving lessons.  

Have fun ðŸ˜€

### Troubleshooting

If you have problems running, check Wiki page [Running](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=running).  
All settings and logs are saved to user folder, see [Paths](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=paths). It is also shown on 1st Help page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Editor

In editor - F1 (or tilde) key shows/hides GUI,  
Tab key - switches between Camera and Edit modes.  
Press Ctrl-F1 to read what can be edited and how.  

There is no undo, so use F5 to reload last track state, and F4 to save it (often).  
After each save, track can be tested in game.
